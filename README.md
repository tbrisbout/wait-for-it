# Wait for it

> I want to build a todo command line app (preferably in Golang).
One important feature is a queue system so when someone ask me to do some work, I can queue their request on my todo list and give them an order (or estimated wait time) for their request to be taken into account. Can you give me some directions on how to build this ?
